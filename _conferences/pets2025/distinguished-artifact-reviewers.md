## What makes a good artifact reviewer?

- Providing actionable items & questions for each badge.
- Following up and responding to authors’ comments in a timely manner.
- Rerunning the artifact after the authors’ changes and finalizing the artifact.
- Going above & beyond: reviewers who have volunteered for artifacts that
  require hardware resources, etc.
